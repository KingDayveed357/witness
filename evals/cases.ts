// Eval suite 1: decision quality (docs/evals.md). Version suite1-v2: 76 cases across 9 categories.
// v1 -> v2 (2026-10-12 evaluation audit): v1 filed three price controls (expected CAPTURE) under
// "overpriced", contradicting the plan's "6 overpriced cases -> HOLD". They moved unchanged to
// "price_control" (v1 over-04/05/06 = v2 price-01/02/03), three genuinely overpriced cases were
// added (over-07/08/09), and an exact-threshold control was added (price-04). No expected outcome
// of an existing case was changed.
// Each case: a confirmed policy, the agent's request, the product facts Witness would fetch, and the
// expected outcome. `acceptable` lists other outcomes that are still safe (never CAPTURE for a bad cart).
// Dave: review these. They define what "correct" means for the published numbers.
